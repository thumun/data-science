### Analysis

1. In this lab we are thinking about poisonous vs. edible mushrooms. For this application, would you prefer a higher or lower classification threshold? Explain your reasoning.

I would prefer a lower classification threshold in this circumstance. Since
the poison is +1 and edible is -1. Which means that a higher threshold means
the mushroom is more likely to be poisonous.
It would be better to eat a mushroom that is not poisonous (so lower
threshold would help with that).

2. Come up with one example application where you would prefer a low (below 50% threshold) and one where you would prefer a high (above 50% threshold). (Excluding examples from class and from this lab.)

High threshold:
For a high risk scenario, where someone's life may be at risk and a high
degree of certainty is needed before taking action. One such example could be
something in the medical field like accessing for signs of a tumor
before doing a surgery.

Low threshold:
Looking for an obscure/not well-known thing on a search engine would be in an
example. Since it's not well known, even if the results may not be exactly 
relevant it could still be useful (may have a reference to the obscure topic).
