### Analysis

Part 1

The empty array has random content that is dependent on the state of the memory.
(according to the NumPy tutorial)

Part 2

(Since the array is made up of random numbers I will be describing what would
  be printed.)

Printed statement: ex_array_2d[2]

Prints the entire third row of the original array. This is a 1 dimensional
array.

Printed statement: ex_array_2d[:,1]

Prints the same number of rows from the original array and one column. The
new array is made up of the second column of the original array. This new array
has the following dimensions: 5 x 1.

Printed statement: ex_array_2d[:3,:2]

Prints a 3 x 2 array based on the original. This new array takes the first
three rows and the first two columns. So a total of 6 numbers make up this
array.

Part 3

The original graph (with 10 points) showed the quadratic and the cubic as  
curves. The cubic wasn't as smooth as the quadratic but the curve is visible.

When more points are added (added 10 more), the curve for the cubic became
smoother. The quadratic also became smoother (but it was already a defined
curve).


Part 4

When a student is added with the same key as a prior one, the key stays the same but the value is updated with the new student's information.

When a new entry with a new key but repeated value is added, the entry is added to the dictionary normally. (Does not matter if the value is repeated - treated the same as other entries)

3. Describe the biggest challenge you faced on this lab:

  Numpy array manipulation syntax were a bit difficult to understand
  (slicing).
